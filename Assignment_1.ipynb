        "This report will contain information about the review of a chosen machine learning literature and its critique. The chosen literature for this review will be the paper titled “Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces : Recognition Using Class Specific Linear Projection” which is written by Peter N. Belhumeur, Joao P. Hespanha and David J. Kriegma. Its critiques will be separated into many different parts for the purpose of making the report easier to read and understand."

        "This literature paper contains information about the development of a new algorithm on face recognition which will not be affected by face expressions and lighting direction. For the last few years, many algorithms have been developed for the purpose of face recognition but as there is a huge improvement for this matter, other factors such as facial expression and light direction have been major obstacles on making a better algorithm.  In this literature paper, a new approach has been proposed to be able to resist these factors which will lead to a more accurate and better results."
